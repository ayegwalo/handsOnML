## How would you define Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is part of AI that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns in data. 

## Can you name four types of applications where Machine Learning shines?
1. Image recognition (e.g., facial recognition)
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) (e.g., language translation, sentiment analysis)
3. Predictive analytics (e.g., predicting customer behavior or stock prices)
4. Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix or Amazon product recommendations)

## What is a labeled training set?
A labeled training set is a dataset where each input data point is paired with the correct output. In supervised learning, this helps the algorithm learn the relationship between input features and output labels to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## What are the two most common supervised tasks?
1. Classification (e.g., spam email detection, image classification)
2. Regression (e.g., predicting house prices, stock market predictions)

## Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
1. Clustering (e.g., grouping similar articles)
2. Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection in transactions)
3. Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA to reduce feature space)
4. Association rule learning (e.g., market basket analysis to identify item associations)

## What type of algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
Reinforcement learning algorithm will be used for this type of problem, as it involves an agent (the robot) learning to make decisions based on feedback from the environment (rewards or penalties) over time.

## What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?
A clustering algorithm, such as K-means or DBSCAN, is commonly used to segment customers into groups based on shared characteristics or behaviors.
